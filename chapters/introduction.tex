\section{Introduction}

MonPoly \cite{Basin2017} is a tool for runtime monitoring, also called Runtime Verification (RV) \cite{Bartocci2018}.
Runtime monitoring is a method for checking a systems behaviour against a formal specification during or after execution of the system.
If the monitoring happens during execution this is called online monitoring and if it is done after the system is done executing we call this offline monitoring.
MonPoly is capable of both forms of monitoring.
The monitoring is done on a trace of the system.
A trace refers to a timestamped log of events.
