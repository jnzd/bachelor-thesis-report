\chapter{Architecture}

In this section we introduce the general architecture of our wrapper for MonPoly.
A more in depth look at the specific technical implementation will be provided in the implementation section.
In general, we have three components for this project.
On one hand we have the MonPoly with a few extensions.
On the other hand is QuestDB.
Our wrapper acts as the glue between the two.
In addition the wrapper also provides a new interface to MonPoly in the form of a REST API.
Figure \ref{fig:wrapper} shows the structure of the MonPoly wrapper.

\section{Wrapper}

The wrapper can be run directly on a system with MonPoly installed.
The alternative and more portable way to run it is with a Docker container.
For Docker, the MonPoly Docker image is used as a base image and then the wrapper code and the required Python libraries are installed on top.
In the end the wrapper is simply run like any Flask app.

A QuestDB instance must be running separately.
This can be on the same system locally or somewhere on a remote server.
The connection details for QuestDB, like ports, username, database password, and hostname must be configured in the wrapper for it to be fully operational.

On a high level the user first provides the connection information for the database.
Next a policy and a signature must be sent to the wrapper.
If the signature and policy are monitorable, the user can issue a command to start the monitor and from this point onward the wrapper will accept and process incoming events.

At any point the user can issue a policy change by sending the appropriate command and the new policy.
The wrapper will then perform the policy change and report once it is complete.

\section{The REST API}

In this section we provide a list of all the REST API endpoints, describe their purpose, and give some basic usage examples.

\input{chapters/architecture/rest-api.tex}

The wrapper also provides various "getter"- and "setter"- methods for the configuration details of QuestDB.
They do not change the configuration of QuestDB itself, but simply tell the wrapper how to reach QuestDB.
These should be fairly self-explanatory.
We will quickly list them here for completeness. 
For more information on what each of these values does, the QuestDB documentation \cite{questdb,questdb-postgres-wire,questdb-influx-db-line-protocol} can be consulted.
The QuestDB related endpoints are:
\texttt{/db-set-user}, \\
\texttt{/db-set-password}, \\
\texttt{/db-set-host}, \\
\texttt{/db-set-pgsql-port}, \\
\texttt{/db-set-influxdb-port}, \\
\texttt{/db-set-database}, \\
\texttt{/db-get-user}, \\
\texttt{/db-get-password}, \\
\texttt{/db-get-host}, \\
\texttt{/db-get-pgsql-port},\\
\texttt{/db-get-influxdb-port}, and \\
\texttt{/db-get-database}.
