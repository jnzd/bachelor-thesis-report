\begin{lemma}
    \label{lem:map-union-subsets}
    Let $M$ and $N$ be masked predicate maps, then
    \begin{equation*}
        M \subseteqmap M \Cupmerge N
    \end{equation*}
    and
    \begin{equation*}
        N \subseteqmap M \Cupmerge N.
    \end{equation*}
\end{lemma}
\textit{Proof}
Since the definition of $M \Cupmerge N$ is symmetric, it suffices to show on of the two relations in the lemma.
From Definition \ref{def:e-rel-int-ops} it follows that any key consisting of a predicate and a mask is also in $M \Cupmerge N$.
Since the mask is there unaltered, it satisfies the condition of being no more precise than the one in $M$.
The condition for $(I \subseteq I')$ is apparent from the definition as well, no interval is discarded and all intervals are either enlarged by the special union of intervals or kept the same.
