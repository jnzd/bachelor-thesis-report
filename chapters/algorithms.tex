\section{Policy Change}
This section gives a high level view of our policy change method.
The individual parts of the policy change will be explained in the following sections of this chapter.
We have a running instance of MonPoly monitoring some policy.
The user asks the wrapper to monitor a new policy.
The wrapper checks the monitorability of the new policy against the existing policy.
If it is not monitorable the wrapper keeps the current instance of MonPoly running and reports the issue with the new policy to the user.
Otherwise the wrapper uses MonPoly to get the extended relative intervals of the new policy.
Then these extended relative intervals get converted to SQL queries and the wrapper runs these queries on QuestDB.
The response from QuestDB gets converted into a MonPoly log file.
Next the wrapper stops the current iteration of MonPoly and starts a new one that first reads the created log file.
At this point the policy change is done, and the wrapper can continue with its normal operation.

\section{Conversion to SQL-Query}
Now let's consider how we can convert the extended relative intervals as we have them in Figure \ref{fig:example-ext-intervals} to a SQL query.
On a high level we have one \texttt{SELECT} query for each table corresponding to a predicate. The different masks and their relative intervals are appended as conjunctions with a single \texttt{WHERE} clause.
Let's assume we have a predicate $p$ with $n \in \mathbb{N}$ mask- relative interval tuples, $((m_1, r_1), \dots (m_n,r_n))$.
Variable values in a mask are disregarded.
If the constant values in a mask $m_i = (m_{i1}, \dots, m_{i{\iota(p)}})$ 
have the indices $j_1, \dots, j_l$, with 
$l \leq \iota(p)$
and the relative interval is $[a,b)$, then the corresponding SQL clause is \texttt{WHERE (x<$j_1$> = $m_{ij_1}$ AND ... AND x<$j_l$> AND ts >= $a$ AND ts < $b$)}.
Depending on whether an interval bound is open or closed, the corresponding comparison operators are used.
If an interval is unbounded, then that bound is omitted and all events are retrieved.
When multiple masks and intervals for a predicate exist, multiple of the described conditions are concatenated with \texttt{AND}.
This approach adds potentially overlapping conditions.
A good query processor will hopefully recognize those and make optimizations when appropriate.
We run every query for each predicate on the database.
One additional query is necessary for the \texttt{ts} table that gets all time points in the relative interval covering the whole formula.
For our example policy in Figure \ref{fig:example-policy} with the extended relative intervals as seen in Figure \ref{fig:example-ext-intervals} and the schema in Figure \ref{fig:example-policy-schema} we get the following SQL query.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \label{fig:ext-sql-query}
\begin{lstlisting}
FROM loc_accessed SELECT * WHERE (x2 = "advertising" AND
                                  time_stamp >= $\tau_i - 0$ AND
                                  time_stamp <= $\tau_i - 0$)
FROM perm_granted SELECT * WHERE (time_stamp <= $\tau_i - 0$)
FROM perm_revoked SELECT * WHERE (time_stamp <= $\tau_i - 0$)
FROM ts           SELECT * WHERE (time_stamp <= $\tau_i - 0$)
\end{lstlisting}
    \caption{Extended Relative Intervals of Example Policy}
\end{figure}

The time stamp is converted to a Unix style time stamp string that can be understood by QuestDB \cite{questdb-time-stamps}
