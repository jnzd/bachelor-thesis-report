  abstract = {Data protection regulations stipulate that organizations processing user data must do so respecting the fine-grained consent provided by each user. This requirement has led to a proliferation of solutions for consent collection. However, existing solutions do not guarantee that data usage complies with the collected consent. A general way for organizations to achieve compliance is to write their applications in a programming language that automatically enforces fine-grained user-defined consent at runtime. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm, Tag, Track & Control (TTC), that combines dynamic information flow control and run-time verification in a novel way to allow for the development of such programming languages. In TTC, user inputs are associated with unique taints that are dynamically propagated at runtime. Before any critical operation occurs, events parametrized with such taints are logged in a trace. Users specify their individual consent via data usage policies that define sets of admissible traces. By referring to the taints, policies can specify allowed information flows. When a runtime monitor detects an attempted violation, the execution of the critical operation is disallowed, ensuring policy compliance. We build sound foundations for TTC, present its applications, develop a programming language that implements TTC, and put it into practice with a proof-of-concept privacy-preserving application. Our evaluation demonstrates TTC's generality, usability, and modest performance overhead.},
