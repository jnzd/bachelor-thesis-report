  abstract = {Data protection regulations stipulate that organizations processing user data must do so respecting the fine-grained consent provided by each user. This requirement has led to a proliferation of solutions for consent collection. However, existing solutions do not guarantee that data usage complies with the collected consent. A general way for organizations to achieve compliance is to write their applications in a programming language that automatically enforces fine-grained user-defined consent at runtime. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm, Tag, Track & Control (TTC), that combines dynamic information flow control and run-time verification in a novel way to allow for the development of such programming languages. In TTC, user inputs are associated with unique taints that are dynamically propagated at runtime. Before any critical operation occurs, events parametrized with such taints are logged in a trace. Users specify their individual consent via data usage policies that define sets of admissible traces. By referring to the taints, policies can specify allowed information flows. When a runtime monitor detects an attempted violation, the execution of the critical operation is disallowed, ensuring policy compliance. We build sound foundations for TTC, present its applications, develop a programming language that implements TTC, and put it into practice with a proof-of-concept privacy-preserving application. Our evaluation demonstrates TTC's generality, usability, and modest performance overhead.},

  abstract = {<p>In this article, we introduce a comprehensive framework supporting a privacy-aware access control mechanism, that is, a mechanism tailored to enforce access control to data containing personally identifiable information and, as such, privacy sensitive. The key component of the framework is a family of models (P-RBAC) that extend the well-known RBAC model in order to provide full support for expressing highly complex privacy-related policies, taking into account features like purposes and obligations. We formally define the notion of privacy-aware permissions and the notion of conflicting permission assignments in P-RBAC, together with efficient conflict-checking algorithms. The framework also includes a flexible authoring tool, based on the use of the SPARCLE system, supporting the high-level specification of P-RBAC permissions. SPARCLE supports the use of natural language for authoring policies and is able to automatically generate P-RBAC permissions from these natural language specifications. In the article, we also report performance evaluation results and contrast our approach with other relevant access control and privacy policy frameworks such as P3P, EPAL, and XACML.</p>},
